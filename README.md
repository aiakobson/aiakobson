### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  My name is Anastasiia, I am a project manager. Since 2022 I have been working on IT projects. Real talk: in the beginning it was a really hard time, so many technical terms, feeling not smart and adjusting to the new environment. I was so scared, you have no idea. However, I have been eager to understand my team members better so I started learning SQL and Python.

  My team is working on machine learning projects, in my free time I also manage projects for non-commercial organisations.
Contact me via LinkedIn to know more about my experience.
